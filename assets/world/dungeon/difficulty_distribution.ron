/// Distribution of different dungeon levels.
///
/// first number is dungeon level, integer
/// second number is probability, any normal positive float (not a NaN, for example)
///
/// Values are relative to each other,
/// lesser probability means there will be less dungeons.
///
/// General rules:
/// 1) Probability should not be less or equal to zero
/// 2) Keep it synced with number of dungeon levels
/// 3) Keep these pairs sorted from lowest to highest tier
