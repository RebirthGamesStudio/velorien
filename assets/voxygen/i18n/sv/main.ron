        "main.notice": r#"Welcome to the alpha version of Veloren!

Before you dive into the fun, please keep a few things in mind:

- This is a very early alpha. Expect bugs, extremely unfinished gameplay, unpolished mechanics, and missing features.

- If you have constructive feedback or bug reports, you can contact us via Reddit, GitLab, or our community Discord server.

- Veloren is licensed under the GPL 3 open-source licence. That means you're free to play, modify, and redistribute the game however
 you wish (provided derived work is also under GPL 3).

- Veloren is a non-profit community project, and everybody working on it is a volunteer.
If you like what you see, you're welcome to join the development or art teams!

Thanks for taking the time to read this notice, we hope you enjoy the game!
