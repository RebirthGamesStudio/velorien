// Loot table that exists purely for price rationalisation
// Put here anything that doesn't fit in anything else.
//
// This loot table should be marked as un-sellable.
// If you want to add something that merchants can buy and sell,
// add another loot table
//
// Please keep it sorted by rarity so it's easier to reason about things
