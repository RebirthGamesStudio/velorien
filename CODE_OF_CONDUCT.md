# The Veloren Code of Conduct

## Conduct

**Contact**: [velorenmods@gmail.com](mailto:velorenmods@gmail.com)

- We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
  all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual
  orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age,
  religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.
- On Discord, Gitlab, or any other community area, please avoid using overtly
  sexual nicknames or other nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe
  and welcoming environment for all.
- Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
- Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or
  implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom
  a right answer.
- We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone.
  That is not welcome behavior; we strive to be inclusive. In particular, we
  don't tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.
- Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel
  you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community
  member, please contact one of the `@admin` or `@core developers` roles on
  Discord, or email [velorenmods@gmail.com](mailto:velorenmods@gmail.com).
  Whether you're a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this
  community a safe place for you and we've got your back.
- Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing
  behavior is not welcome.

## Moderation

These are the policies for upholding our community's standards of conduct. If
you feel that a thread needs moderation, please contact the `@admin` or `@core
developers` roles on Discord, or send an email to
[velorenmods@gmail.com](mailto:velorenmods@gmail.com)

1. Remarks that violate the Veloren standards of conduct, including hateful,
   hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed. (Cursing in
   general is discouraged, and never tolerated if targeting another user, and
   never in a hateful manner.)
2. Remarks that moderators find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of
   conduct or not, are also not allowed.
3. Moderators will first respond to such remarks with a warning.
4. If the warning is unheeded, the user will be "kicked," i.e., kicked out of
   the communication channel to cool off.
5. If the user comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be banned,
   i.e., indefinitely excluded.
6. Moderators may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user if it was a
   first offense and they offer the offended party a genuine apology.
7. If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it
   up with that moderator, or with a different moderator, **in private**.
   Complaints about bans in-channel are not allowed.
8. Moderators, organization members, and anyone closely involved with the
   Veloren project are held to a higher standard than other community members.
   If a moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less
   leeway than others.

In the Veloren community we strive to go the extra step to look out for each
other. Don't just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to be your best self.
In particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues, particularly
if they're off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary fights, hurt
feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away from the community
entirely.

And if someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be
defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize. Even
if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good there
was something you could've communicated better â€” remember that it's your
responsibility to make your fellow Veloren community members comfortable.
Everyone wants to get along and we are all here first and foremost because we
want to talk about making games. You will find that people will be eager to
assume good intent and forgive as long as you earn their trust.

The enforcement policies listed above apply to all official Veloren venues;
including all Veloren Discord channels; Gitlab and GitHub repositories under
Veloren; and any other social media platforms related to Veloren.
