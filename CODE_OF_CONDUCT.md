# The Veloren Code of Conduct

## Conduct

# TODO: Fix email
**Contact**:
[amethyst-mods@amethyst-engine.org](mailto:amethyst-mods@amethyst-engine.org)

* We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
  all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual
  orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age,
  religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.
* On Discord, Gitlab, or any other community area, please avoid using overtly
  sexual nicknames or other nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe
  and welcoming environment for all.
* Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
* Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or
  implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom
  a right answer.
  # TODO: Change to suit Veloren a bit more
* Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you
  want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
  # TODO: Reword to ban for harassment?
* We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone.
  That is not welcome behavior; we strive to be inclusive. In particular, we
  don't tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.
* Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel
  you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community
  member, please contact one of the `@admin` or `@core developers` Whether
  you're a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this
  community a safe place for you and we've got your back.
  # TODO: Reword some of this
* Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing
  behavior is not welcome.
* Keep political and religious discussions out of the public Amethyst spaces.
  # TODO: Mention that we have 0 tolerence for harassment regardless of skill


# TODO: Include important server rules
```
- Please keep discussion on topic. We have an #off-topic channel for discussion not relevant to Veloren.

- Profanity, although not explicitly disallowed, should not be used to offend, abuse, bully, or otherwise cause distress for other server users.

- This server is a safe space for all. We do not permit bigotry. This includes (but is not limited to) sexism, racism, ableism, transphobia, antisemitism, etc.

- NSFW content is not permitted, although we do permit discussion of adult issues in #off-topic. Use your common sense, and be aware that many of the server's users are young.

- Role pinging is permitted for urgent or important issues (critical bugs, moderation issues, etc.). Consider pinging a specific person or not pinging at all otherwise.

- Server moderators reserve the right to modify these rules or apply their own common-sense when making moderation decisions.
```

## Moderation

# TODO: Set up mod team page
These are the policies for upholding our community's standards of conduct. If
you feel that a thread needs moderation, please contact the [Amethyst moderation
team][mod_team].

# TODO: Read throug this
1. Remarks that violate the Amethyst standards of conduct, including hateful,
   hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed. (Cursing in
   general is discouraged, and never tolerated if targeting another user, and
   never in a hateful manner.)
2. Remarks that moderators find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of
   conduct or not, are also not allowed.
3. Moderators will first respond to such remarks with a warning.
4. If the warning is unheeded, the user will be "kicked," i.e., kicked out of
   the communication channel to cool off.
5. If the user comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be banned,
   i.e., indefinitely excluded.
6. Moderators may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user if it was a
   first offense and they offer the offended party a genuine apology.
7. If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it
   up with that moderator, or with a different moderator, **in private**.
   Complaints about bans in-channel are not allowed.
8. Moderators, organization members, and anyone closely involved with the
   Amethyst project are held to a higher standard than other community members.
   If a moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less
   leeway than others.

In the Amethyst community we strive to go the extra step to look out for each
other. Don't just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to be your best self.
In particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues, particularly
if they're off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary fights, hurt
feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away from the community
entirely.

And if someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be
defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize. Even
if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good there
was something you could've communicated better â€” remember that it's your
responsibility to make your fellow Amethyst community members comfortable.
Everyone wants to get along and we are all here first and foremost because we
want to talk about making games. You will find that people will be eager to
assume good intent and forgive as long as you earn their trust.

The enforcement policies listed above apply to all official Amethyst venues;
including all Amethyst Discord channels; GitHub repositories under amethyst; and
the community forums at https://community.amethyst.rs
